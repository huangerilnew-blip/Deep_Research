### 摘要
AMA Update covers a range of health care topics affecting the lives of physicians, residents, medical students and patients. And when you have that kind of structure, it offers tremendous opportunities to understand what are the enhancements that technology can bring to the everyday work that we have, to our objectives to achieve the quadruple aim—whether that's patient outcomes, population management, health care costs or provider wellness—all of those are more important than they've ever been. I'll mention another thing, Todd, because I think last time I was on, we talked a little bit about our Aim High Program, where we were funding five external health systems to deploy AI in randomized trials to do rigorous real-world evaluation. So it's built upon that foundation of, how do we effectively educate, how do we maintain, and how do we reach our performance targets with respect to the way we think about a large population of patients whose health we want to improve? Get videos with expert opinions from the AMA on the most important health care topics affecting physicians, residents, medical students and patients—delivered to your inbox.

### 摘要
85% of healthcare leaders are adopting generative AI at scale to streamline clinical productivity and patient engagement. From diagnostic tools to organizational optimization, AI is shaping the way clinicians deliver care and patients receive it. The Engineering for Professionals program at Johns Hopkins University (JHU EP) explains AI’s new role in healthcare and where it’s expected to go. Moreover, 85% of healthcare leaders are adopting generative AI at scale to streamline clinical productivity and patient engagement. AI systems rely heavily on large volumes of patient data to learn and make decisions, often drawing from electronic health records, genetic information, and even real-time data from wearable devices. *   Healthcare Machine Learning Engineer: Designs and deploys AI models tailored to clinical environments and patient needs. *   Medical Informatics Specialist: Bridges gaps between healthcare IT systems and clinical practice, often managing data integration for AI tools. Collaboration among technology, medicine, ethics, and public policy professionals is needed to create clinically effective, ethical, and scalable AI solutions for healthcare.

### 摘要
## How is AI used in health care? Unsurprisingly, AI presents a wealth of opportunities to health care, where providers can use it to enhance a variety of common medical processes—from diagnosing diseases to identifying the best treatment plans for patients facing critical illnesses like cancer. ## What are some examples of the use of AI in health care? In the future, AI in mental health care could look like identifying patterns from the many sources of data patients interact with daily (medical records, search history, or social media posts and usage, for example) to diagnosis illness, or it could look like natural language processing algorithms tracking the sentiment of the words they use online or in emails to intercede when a patient might be in crisis. AI provides a number of benefits to the field of health care, the professionals working within it, and the patients who interact with it every day. ## Explore AI in health care with Coursera.

### 摘要
Artificial Intelligence (AI) in Healthcare & Medical Field. One of the greatest strengths of AI in healthcare is its ability to analyze vast amounts of clinical data quickly, helping professionals identify disease markers, patient risks, and population health trends that might otherwise be missed. Natural language processing is proving to be an invaluable tool in healthcare – allowing medical professionals to use artificial intelligence to more accurately diagnose illnesses and provide better personalized treatments for their patients. Diagnosis and treatment of disease has been at the core of artificial intelligence AI in healthcare for the last 50 years. With artificial intelligence AI in healthcare leading the charge in improving patient care, medical professionals can be confident that they can focus on delivering quality care while also saving time and money with AI-powered administrative tasks. Healthcare AI systems can analyze patterns in a patient's medical history and current health data to predict potential health risks.

### 摘要
# The Benefits of the Latest AI Technologies for Patients and Clinicians. When clinicians get up to speed on AI, Farhat says that they will be able to use the latest tools strategically to benefit their practices, their health systems, and the patients they serve. 1. ***AI can automate tasks to free up a clinician’s time to focus more on their patients, “humanizing” care in new ways.*** With many health care providers feeling overworked today, tools like medical scribe technology can automatically capture visit notes and store them in a patient’s medical record, even flagging key details and insights. When clinicians are looking at similar cases to predict who will best respond to certain treatment options, AI can help them better personalize their treatment regimens. By scanning large data sets to find similar cases, AI can help clinicians not only get to a diagnosis more quickly but also find examples of treatments that have been effective in people with this condition.
